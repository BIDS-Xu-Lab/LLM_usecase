    "### Entity Markup Guides:\n",
    "Use <span class=\"Language_Fluent\"> to denote a language spoken by the patient fluently.\n",
    "Use <span class=\"Language_Some\"> to denote a language spoken by the patient in moderate level.\n",
    "Use <span class=\"Language_No\"> To denote a language which cannot be spoken or can only be spoken a little by the patient.\n",
    "Use <span class=\"Language_Other\"> to denote a language that not related to patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entity Definitions:\n",
    "Language_Fluent: The person speaks the language fluently, including native speakers and those who have achieved nearnative fluency. They can use the language effectively in  various contexts with complete fluency and cultural understanding. Instances where a patient’s fluency is not explicitly stated but can be directly inferred (e.g. mention of interpreter/translator, preference of language on prescription) are included in this definition.\n",
    "Language_Some: The person has a moderate level of proficiency in the language. They can understand and use the language for basic communication and simple conversations but are not fully fluent.\n",
    "Language_No: The person knows a few words or phrases in the language but cannot use it for basic communication. Their knowledge is very limited and not sufficient for meaningful  interaction. Or the person does not know or speak the language at all. Cannot use this Language to communicate at all.\n",
    "Language_Other: Languages mentioned in the text that are not related to the person’s language proficiency. These may be languages discussed in a different context or related to other individuals. Words that could refer to a language but are not used in that context (e.g. Greek yogurt, Irish Catholic, French catheter size) should not be annotated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Rules:\n",
    "1. Only annotate the name of the language itself.\n",
    "2. Do not annotate descriptive words about the language proficiency level (e.g. \"some\", \"simple\") or negations (e.g. \"not\", \"no\").\n",
    "3. Hyphenated languages (ex. Chinese-Mandarin) or language connected by \"/\" should be labelled separately for each token.\n",
